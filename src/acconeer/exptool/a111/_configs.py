            The RSS supports two different repetition modes. They determine how and when data

            * **On demand / host driven**: The sensor produces data when requested by the

              This is the default mode, and may be used with all power save modes.

            * **Streaming / sensor driven**: The sensor produces data at a fixed rate, given by a
              configurable accurate hardware timer. This mode is recommended if exact timing
              between updates is required.

            The Exploration Tool is capable of setting the update rate also in *on demand (host

            With the SW version 2 release, a sensor signal normalization functionality is activated
            by default for the Power Bins, Envelope, and IQ Service. This results in a more
            constant signal for different temperatures and sensors. The radar sweeps are normalized
            to have similar amplitude independent of sensor gain and hardware averaging, resulting
            in only minor visible effect in the sweeps when adjusting these parameters.

            We recommend this setting especially for applications, where absolute radar amplitudes
            are important, such as when comparing to a previously recorded signal or to a fixed
            threshold.

            More technically, the functionality is implemented to collect data when starting the
            service, but not transmitting pulses. This data is then used to determine the current
            sensitivity of receiving part of the radar by estimating the power level of the noise,
            which then is used to normalize the collected sweeps. In the most low-power systems,
            where a service is created to collect just a single short sweep before turning off, the
            sensor normalization can add a non-negligible part to the power consumption.

            Please note, that due to the nature of Sparse data, the Sparse service does not support
            noise level normalization. Instead, normalization during processing is recommended,
            such as done in the Presence detector.

            The MMD is the maximum value for the range end, i.e., the range start + length. The MMD
            is smaller than the MUR due to hardware limitations.

            The MUR is the maximum distance at which an object can be located to guarantee that its

            the MUR may fold into the measured range. For example, with a MUR of 10 m, an object at
            12 m could become visible at 2 m.

            A higher setting gives a larger MUR/MMD, but comes at a cost of increasing the

            In Sparse, each frame is a collection of several sweeps over the selected distance

            performed, i.e. the rate at which each distance point is scanned. If you set the sweep
            rate to 4000 Hz and the sweeps per frame to 32, each Sparse data frame will contain 32
            sweeps over the selected distance range, where the sweeps are measured at a rate of
            4000 Hz.

            The maximum possible sweep rate...

            - Is roughly inversely proportional to the number of depth points measured (affected by
              the **range interval** and **downsampling factor**).
            - Is roughly inversely proportional to **HW accelerated average samples**.
            - Depends on the **sampling mode**. Mode A is roughly :math:`4/3 \approx 130\%` slower
              than mode B with the same configuration.
