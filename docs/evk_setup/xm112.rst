Setting up your XM112
=====================

Finding the serial port
-----------------------

On Windows, use device manager to find the port which will be listed as ``USB Serial Port``. It's most likely ``COMx`` where ``x`` is 3 or higher. On Linux, it's likely ``/dev/ttyUSBx`` where ``x`` is 0 or some other integer.

PySerial has a simple tool for listing all ports available::

   python -m serial.tools.list_ports

Flashing
--------

For detailed flashing instructions, see section 2 in the `module software user guide <https://developer.acconeer.com/download/xm112-module-software-user-guide-pdf/>`_.

We recommend flashing using BOSSA (`website <http://www.shumatech.com/web/products/bossa>`_, `GitHub <https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA>`_). **BOSSA 1.9 or newer is supported**.

To get into the bootloader:

- Hold down the ERASE button
- Push the NRST button
- Release the NRST button
- Let go of the ERASE button

Now you should be able to flash the Module software (``acc_module_server_xm112.bin``). After flashing, press the NRST button to reboot into the flashed software.

If you're on Linux you likely will need to compile BOSSA on your own. In our experience, running Ubuntu 18.04, you will need to install ``libreadline-dev`` and ``libwxgtk3.0-dev`` before compiling with ``make``.
To get everything you need::

   sudo apt install libreadline-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev make build-essential

To flash::

   sudo ./bin/bossac -e -w -v -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b /path/to/acc_module_server_xm112.bin
