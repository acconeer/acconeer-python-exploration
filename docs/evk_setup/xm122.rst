Flashing
--------

Download the module software from our `developer page <https://developer.acconeer.com/>`_. In the archive, ``acconeer_xm122_module_software_v*.zip``, you'll find ``acc_module_server_dfu_package.zip``, which is the package to flash.

We recommend flashing using the Python library `nrfutil <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil>`_. Install it with::

   python -m pip install nrfutil

Enter the XM122 bootloader by doing the following:

- Hold down the DFU button
- Push the RESET button
- Release the RESET button
- Let go of the DFU button

Now you should be able to flash::

   nrfutil dfu serial -pkg acc_module_server_dfu_package.zip -p /dev/ttyUSB0

After flashing, press the RESET button to reboot into the flashed software.
