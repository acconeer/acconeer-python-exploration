   Direct leakage
      Direct leakage refers to the transmission of the radar signal directly from the transmitter to the receiver without reflecting off a target. The length of the direct leakage varies with the transmitted pulse length. The transmitted pulse length is set using :term:`Profiles<Profile>`.

   PCR
      Pulsed Coherent Radar.

   PRF
      Pulse repetition frequency. The frequency at which the radar transmits wavelets.

   Profile
      Profiles are used to set the transmitted pulse length in discreet steps. The higher the Profile, the longer the transmitted pulse length.

   SNR
      Abbreviation of *Signal-to-noise ratio*.
      General ratios quantify how much more there is of *one thing* (Signal in this case),
      compared to the *other thing* (noise). Generally, a high SNR means high signal quality.

   Reflectivity
      A property of physical materials.
      If a material is more *reflective*, more power finds its way back to the sensor and vice versa.

   Radar Cross Section
      Depends on the shape of the :term:`Object` measured. Affects how much power returns to the sensor.

   Object
      The physical thing a sensor should measure.

   Detector
      A reusable, well tested, package-offering that consists of an API for
      :term:`Sensor Control`, higher-level output (like distance to :term:`objects<Object>`)
      all backed by signal processing algorithms.

      Detectors are used to enable many use cases.
      They are diligently used in our :term:`Reference Applications<Reference Application>`.

   Sensor Control
      Describes controlling the sensor on a low level or the sequence of sensor *verbs*
      (``prepare``, ``measure``, ``process``, ``power_on``, etc.) in the context of
      :term:`Detectors<Detector>`,
      :term:`Reference Applications<Reference Application>` or
      :term:`Example Applications<Example Application>`.

   Reference Application
      A nearly complete use case specific package-offering.
      Unlike :term:`Detectors<Detector>`, these packages are targeting more specific
      use cases, such as *Tank Level* or *Parking*.

   Example Application
      A use case specific proof-of-concept signal processing algorithm
      that haven't undergone significant testing, but works quite well in the scenarios tested.

   Exploration Tool
      Acconeer's graphical sensor evaluation application.
      All
      :term:`Detectors<Detector>`,
      :term:`Reference Applications<Reference Application>` and
      :term:`Example Applications<Example Application>`
      are showcased here and new ones are added continuously.
