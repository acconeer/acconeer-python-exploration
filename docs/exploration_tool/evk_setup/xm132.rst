.. _setup_xm132:

Setting up your XM132
=====================

For detailed instructions, visit our `developer page <https://developer.acconeer.com/>`_.

.. include:: find_serial_port.rst

**Note that the XM132 has two serial ports. Usually, the first port is the one to use.**

Flashing
--------

Download the module software from our `developer page <https://developer.acconeer.com/>`_. In the archive ``acconeer_xm132_module_software_v*.zip``, under ``bin``, you'll find ``acc_module_server.bin`` which is the file to flash.

We recommend flashing using the Python library `stm32loader <https://github.com/florisla/stm32loader>`_. Install it with::

   python -m pip install --user stm32loader

Enter the bootloader by doing the following:

- Hold down the DFU button
- Push the RESET button
- Release the RESET button
- Let go of the DFU button

Now you should be able to flash::

   stm32loader -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -e -w -v -g 0x08000000 acc_module_server.bin

Replace ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` with the serial port of your XM132.
