Common Issues
=============

--------------

#) Newly updated ET shows an error at startup

   ET caches your last configuration for each application you use. Sometimes
   we make changes to the applications in ET, which makes the cache invalid.

   If you face any issues, you can run the command

   .. code-block::

      python -m acconeer.exptool.app --purge-config

   to remove the invalid cache.

#) Import errors with NumPy on Linux

   The solution is to remove all duplicates of NumPy and reinstall using pip::

      sudo apt remove python3-numpy
      python -m pip uninstall numpy       # Repeat until no NumPy version is installed
      python -m pip install --user numpy

   Depending on your environment, you might have to replace ``python`` with ``python3`` or ``py``.

#) The GUI does not load properly after updating

   Try running ``python -m acconeer.exptool.app --purge-config`` from anywhere. Accept the
   removal of the files and try starting Exploration Tool again.

   If the above does not work, please open an issue on GitHub.

#) The GUI does not start and shows an error: ``qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "windows" in ""``.

   This error have been witnessed when Exploration Tool is installed in an Anaconda environment.
   The error may also occur when there are non-ASCII characters in the path.

#) Dropdown menu is out of position

   This is a known issue on for Qt when running Wayland display server. The issue is fixed for Qt version >= 6.4.0.
   (See related issue: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-85297)

#) ``malloc_consolidate(): unaligned fastbin chunk detected`` appears in the console when running ET

   This error has been witnessed when running ET on Ubuntu 22.04.
   The error is usually resolved by selecting *Ubuntu on Xorg* instead of *Ubuntu* in the Ubuntu login screen
   (by pressing the cogwheel in the lower right).

#) Issues with nox tests for Python 3.12

   When running nox tests for Python 3.12, the error ``AttributeError: module 'pkgutil' has no attribute 'ImpImporter'. Did you mean: 'zipimporter'?`` might occur.
   To fix this run ``python -m virtualenv --upgrade-embed-wheels`` to upgrade virtualenv's packages.

#) Problems with downloading latest binary when flashing

   Downloading the latest binary depends on the Acconeer developer site. Update to latest version of Exploration Tool.

#) Cannot unpack GitHub zip on Windows

   The root issue is the ``MAX_PATH`` setting on the Windows platform.
   Try unzipping the zip in a place that's not at deep in your folder structure. To your **Desktop**, for example.

#) What does "Experimental" mean?

   In our code you might encounter features tagged “experimental”. This means that the feature in question is an early version that has a limited test scope, and the API and/or functionality might change in upcoming releases. The intention is to let users try these features out and we appreciate feedback.
