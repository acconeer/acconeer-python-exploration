Getting Started
===============

We recommend most of our customers to get started by installing and getting familiar with Exploration Tool,
see :doc:`setting_up_and_running_et`.

If you are looking to get started with our C SDK, you will find that and many helpful
User Guides on the `Developer site <https://developer.acconeer.com>`_.
