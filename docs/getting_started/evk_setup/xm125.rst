Flashing
--------

The most convenient method to prepare the XM125 board for flashing is to let the Exploration Tool Application
automatically download the latest binary file.

Automatically Download and Flash Using the GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on how you installed in :ref:`installation-and-setup`, start Exploration Tool by either

* Double-clicking the ``run_app`` script,
* Running the command ``python -m acconeer.exptool.app`` in your terminal.

To automatically download the latest binary file:

1. Open the **Flash tool** by selecting the **Flash tab** in the tab selection
2. Click the **Get latest bin file** button

Once the binary file has been downloaded it is possible to start flashing the board by clicking the **Flash** button
in the **Flash tool**. Make sure to select the serial port you found in section :ref:`xm125-finding-the-serial-port`.

Put the XM125 in DFU mode by following the instructions in the prompt. Use the image in :ref:`xm125-hw-overview` for reference.

Automatically Download and Flash Using the CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following command from the CLI::

   python -m acconeer.exptool.flash flash -d XM125 -f

When prompted, put the XM125 in DFU mode by following the instructions. Use the image in :ref:`xm125-hw-overview` for reference.

Manually Download and Flash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by downloading the latest Exploration Server package for XM125  from our `developer page <https://developer.acconeer.com/>`_.
Inside the downloaded package, ``acc_exploration_server_a121.bin`` can be found.

Flash XM125 using the Exploration Tool Application::

   python -m acconeer.exptool.app

or by using the following command::

   python -m acconeer.exptool.flash flash -d XM125 -i acc_exploration_server_a121.bin

If the last command was used, make sure to put the XM125 in DFU mode:

#. Press the DFU-button and hold it
#. Press the RESET-button and hold it
#. Release the RESET-button
#. Release the DFU-button

Use the image in :ref:`xm125-hw-overview` for reference.

After the XM125 has been flashed, it needs to be reset. This is done by pressing and releasing the RESET-button.
