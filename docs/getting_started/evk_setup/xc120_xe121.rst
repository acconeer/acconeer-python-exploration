Setting Up Your XC120 + XE121
=============================

A great way to evaluate the A121 sensor in Exploration Tool is to use the XC120 connector board together with the XE121 evaluation board.
Multiple XS121 satellite boards can also be connected to the XE121 evaluation board for multi-sensor evaluation.
The XS121 satellite board has a small form factor and is connected to the XE121 evaluation board with a flex cable (included with XS121),
enabling high flexibility in the evaluation.
A USB-C cable (not provided by Acconeer) is needed to connect the XC120 board to a PC.

Flashing
--------

The most convenient method to prepare the XC120 board for flashing is to let the Exploration Tool Application
automatically download the latest binary file.

Automatically Download and Flash Using the GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on how you installed in :ref:`installation-and-setup`, start Exploration Tool by either

* Double-clicking the ``run_app`` script,
* Running the command ``python -m acconeer.exptool.app`` in your terminal.

To automatically download the latest binary file:

1. Open the **Flash tool** by selecting the **Flash tab** in the tab selection
2. Click the **Get latest bin file** button

|

Once the binary file has been downloaded it is possible to start flashing the board by clicking the **Flash** button
in the **Flash tool**.

If the device cannot be found in Exploration Tool after flashing, disconnect and reconnect the USB cable and it should be found again.

Automatically Download and Flash Using the CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following command from the CLI::

   python -m acconeer.exptool.flash flash -d XC120 -f

Manually Download and Flash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by downloading the latest Exploration Server package for XC120 from our `developer page <https://developer.acconeer.com/>`_.
The correct package is located under XE121.
Inside the downloaded package, ``acc_exploration_server_a121.bin`` can be found.

There are two ways to flash the downloaded binary, either using Exploration Tool GUI or the command line.

**Using the Exploration Tool GUI:**

Start the Exploration Tool Application::

   python -m acconeer.exptool.app

and flash XC120 with the downloaded binary file:

1. Open the **Flash tool** by selecting the **Flash tab** in the tab selection
2. Click the **Browse** tab
3. Click the **Browse** button and select the downloaded file
4. Start flashing the board by clicking the **Flash** button

**Using the Command Line:**

Flash:

   python -m acconeer.exptool.flash flash -d XC120 -i acc_exploration_server_a121.bin
