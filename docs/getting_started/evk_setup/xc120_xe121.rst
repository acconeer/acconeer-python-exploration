Setting Up Your XC120 + XE121
=============================

A great way to evaluate the A121 sensor in Exploration Tool is to use the XC120 connector board together with the XE121 evaluation board.
Multiple XS121 satellite boards can also be connected to the XE121 evaluation board for multi-sensor evaluation.
The XS121 satellite board has a small form factor and is connected to the XE121 evaluation board with a flex cable (included with XS121),
enabling high flexibility in the evaluation.
A USB-C cable (not provided by Acconeer) is needed to connect the XC120 board to a PC.
