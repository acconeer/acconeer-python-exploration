Depending on how you installed in :ref:`installation-and-setup`, start Exploration Tool by either

* Double-clicking the ``run_app`` script,
* Running the command ``python -m acconeer.exptool.app`` in your terminal.

To automatically download the latest binary file:

1. Open the **Flash tool** by selecting the **Flash tab** in the tab selection
2. Click the **Get latest binary** tab
3. Click the **Get latest bin file** button
